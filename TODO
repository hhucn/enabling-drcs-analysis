calculate ranking
write down ranking
write down expectations

test_calc_rank
explore tie
check that we do actually merge
plot
example graphics

parallelize experiments (optionally)
extend diffing
actually run 1000 experiments!
merge with different sizes

with different days than 60
evaluate whether we can merge using IndexFiles (should be faster)
download_pulls (downloads references to all pulls)
merge: only backout partially
check merge / merge_ours once more
revive spots
run with large dataset over night
think about how to improve
fix accept (symfony)
compare against multiple future commits
compare output future date
try simple diff by checking out twice? might be faster, but ignore .git
